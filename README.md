# Prolific: Git Active — Activity Repo

This is a repo that shows my coding activity, even if the activity is not pushed to GitHub.

This repository is intentionally **not** a source-code project.

Its purpose is to store **anonymized work-activity reports** generated by the
**Prolific: Git Active** background app.

## What this repo contains
- `reports/`: timestamped JSON + Markdown summaries (aggregates only)
- `docs/`: a small static site (GitHub Pages) that renders a timeline bubblemap
- `viz/`: a local copy of the same bubblemap assets

## Privacy
- The generator **never reads file contents**.
- Reports are based on **file metadata only** (size/mtime/extensions).
- Reports contain **no file names or paths**—only totals and estimates.

## Why this exists
Sometimes work happens locally, in private repos, or in testing branches that
never get pushed. This repo provides a lightweight public/private timeline of
activity so contribution history doesn't miss days due to workflow realities.
